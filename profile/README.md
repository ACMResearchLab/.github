## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## ACM Research Lab
This is the github organization for our UCSC ACM Research Lab, founded in spring 2023. Over the course of the quarter, students learn research compilation, how to read technical AI papers, literature review, and writing papers/proposals. Afterward, projects are chosen from proposals to be further developed by multiple groups, advised by leads and professors. Here we will host repositories of research projects developed over all iterations of the lab.  

## Spring 2023 
**Leads:** Arnav Kartikeya, Coen Adler  
**Members:** Aled dela Cruz, An Ngo, Bryce Montgomery, Evan Kellener, Ihina Nath, Joshua Schuman, Kevin Bachelor, Manju Shettar, Thomas Nguyen

### Projects 
We had two projects this iteration 
- **Explainable-Medical-CNNs** (Creating a model pipeline using SAM, GRAD-CAM, and MobileNetv3 to develop a more accurate and generalized approach to testing GRAD-CAM localization abilities) (Members: An Ngo, Evan Kellener, Ihina Nath, Joshua Schuman, Thomas Nguyen)
- **PINNs** (Analyzing the usefulness of Physics Informed Neural Networks on more generalized shapes outside of the traditional airfoil domain) (Members: Aled dela Cruz, Bryce Montgomery, Kevin Bachelor, Manju Shettar)

Read more about each project in their respective repository.
